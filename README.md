# Hi! I am Betul 👋 👩🏾‍💻


![Me!!](https://github.com/Bettysbook/BetulBayraktar/assets/109543973/4bba618a-7882-4e60-970a-619806cd2abe)


I am driven by a passion for continual learning and enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. 
This drive led me to spend ten years as a research assistant in Turkish Language and Literature. 
Now, I am leveraging my experience to transition into the field of IT, where I engage in various projects, either independently or collaboratively with my team.
